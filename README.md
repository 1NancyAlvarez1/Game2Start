# Game Design 2 Starting Project
This is the starting project for Game Design 2 at Wichita State University. It is intended to include everything that was completed in Game Design 1.

Required for setup is the FMOD for [Unreal 5.2 plugin, version 2.02.20](https://www.fmod.com/download). Add the files to the *Game2Start/Plugins/FMODStudio* folder.

[Notes on FMOD integration](https://gist.github.com/brianisbrilliant/b9a15cb337bbb82208a18a5220611b6d).
